   <h3>This one's been a long time coming</h3>

     Ok let's just check the time real quick... yep we're like almost 2 months late.

     <br>

     So if you didn't know I went to the 2024 Anime Expo hosted in Los Angeles this year with my good friend
     <a class = "links" href = "https://twitch.tv/cptspaceboy">conservemomenta</a>
     just to see what it was going to be like.

     We only went for about 1.5 days out of the total 4 days the expo was happening because it was kinda expensive and we didn't want to leave during the weekdays.

     <p class = "footnote">We also thought that 2 days was gonna be enough but the expo closed like half way through the second day so it kinda sucked and I missed out on a large chunk of the artist gallery (which sucked omega hard)</p>
