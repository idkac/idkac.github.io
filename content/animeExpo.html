   <h2>Started 8/21, Finished ?</h2>
   <h3>This one's been a long time coming</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
     Ok let's just check the time real quick... yep we're like almost 2 months late.

     <p class = "footnote">Also big disclaimer I look omega goofy in all of the pictures do not make fun of me</p>
     <br>

     So if you didn't know I went to the 2024 Anime Expo hosted in Los Angeles this year with my good friend
     <a class = "links" href = "https://twitch.tv/cptspaceboy">conservemomenta</a>
     just to see what it was going to be like.

     We only went for about 1.5 days out of the total 4 days the expo was happening because it was kinda expensive and we didn't want to leave during the weekdays.

     <p class = "footnote">We also thought that 2 days was gonna be enough but the expo closed like half way through the second day so it kinda sucked and I missed out on a large chunk of the artist gallery (which sucked omega hard)</p>

     <br>

     But yeah the two days which we did go were July 6 and July 7 (and also July 8 cuz some goofy stuff happened).

   </p>

   <h3>July 7th</h3>

     So to get into the Anime Expo we first had to get our IDs at the Crypto Arena<img src="../assets/images/animeExpo/poggies.png" alt="poggies" class='footnoteImage'>, and we decided to take some pictures in front of the goat.
     </p>

   <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/animeExpo/the-goat.JPG" title = "The Goat" width = "300px">

    </div>

   <p class = "paragraph">
     Omocat was at this expo so obviously the first thing we did as 2 omori degenerates was to b-line to the omocat store, which actually was pretty cool and nice.
     </p>

   <br>

   <p class = "paragraph">
     They also had like a big banner where it was just omocat so we had to do some wap (worship and prayer) in front of the omocat shrine.
     </p>

   <p class = "paragraph">
     After that we did some perusing through all the different stalls, and one of them was doing light novels and was trying to sell their app. So to help with that they had ipads on display that had the app which showed off how cool it was.
     I managed to break out of the app and get it to play a video of Tyler1 instead<img src = "/assets/images/animeExpo/trollcute.JPG" class = "footnoteImage">.

     So after this we did some walking and we took a few pictures with differen cosplayers (the less important ones I'll just dump at the end of the blog), but here are some notable ones that I think are pretty funny:

     Ok this one needs a bit of explaining:

     <br>
     <br>

     Let me just premise this by saying that I don't play Arknights, but one of my good friends kjason stang (who is mentioned in the main page) is an Arknights addict. He unfortunately could not make it to this anime expo, so me and conservemomenta decided to make him feel left out by taking pictures at the Arknights stand as well as with all the characters that are from the game. So here's a picture of that:
     </p>

   <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/animeExpo/kjason-stang-eat-your-heart-out.JPG" title = "kjason stang eat your heart out" width = "600px">
    </div>

   <p class = "footnote">kjason stang eat your heart out</p>

   <br>

   <p class = "paragraph">
     Ok so since we are at the anime expo, there obviously were people there who are big influencers who wanted to make videos, and I happened to find probably the biggest youtube channel who were filming there (outside of gigguk who weren't there on the weekends), which was <a class = "links" href = "https://www.youtube.com/@TheAnimeMen">The Anime Men</a>. And obviously I got a picture with them:
     </p>

   <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/animeExpo/mom-get-the-camera.JPG" title = "MOM GET THE CAMERA" width = "600px">
    </div>

   <p class = "footnote">btw props to conservemomenta for helping me recognize them cuz i kinda didnt recognize them at first</p>

   <p class = "paragraph">
     They were also shooting a video, which I also happened to show up in. So now I can safely say that I am internet famous. If you are curious the video is <a class = "links" href = "https://youtu.be/u6InZ4NRWqQ?si=g8wcY6ct7rYsvdiU&t=304">here</a> and I show up at 5:04.

   <p class = "paragraph">
     So after this I found out there was another Peak Archive stand so obviously I had to take a picture there also. There was also apparently supposed to be a like a live drawing session there, but it was not part of our schedule so I had to miss out
     </p>

     So we all know how some people don't think very fondly of anime right. So there was this one guy who was just at the entrance of the convention doing a whole preach session on microphones telling us to convert to (Christianity I think?). Nothing really funny in particular that happened but I just thought it was kinda goofy the stuff the guy was talking about.
