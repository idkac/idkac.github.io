   <h3>Suzume is disappointing</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
ok so like I really like Makoto Shinkai films right and I was on the airplane from LA to France and I happened to see the movie Suzume
on the plane which I have been really looking forward to.
<br>
<br>

Coming into the movie the only things I really knew was the theme song by RADWIMPS (which goes dumb hard btw) that goes du-du-du-dududu
and really nothing else about the movie, but I had really high hopes because I had seen Makoto Shinkai films before and I thought they
were all really enjoyable (at least an 8).
<br>
<br>

Actually, I do have the notes from my plane ride (yes I took notes on the plane for a movie I don't care) and I'll just drop them here
I guess.
<br>
<br>

Its really long so basically tldr: the fricking movie felt like a bunch of random unnecessary bs that was thrown together without much
cohesion. Also for some reason the fmc just falls in love with the mc for fun even though he was a chair for the large majority of the
movie. I also thought the movie could have been approached much better if they placed a heavier emphasis on the fmc's struggle
overcoming the death of her mom which I found was a much more compelling story and it could have been made into a really interesting
story based on how this movie handled it at the end (basically if they just removed all the worm killing part and just added in more
story about the fmc and discovering what happened to her mother and eventually overcoming that struggle I think it would have been a
much better movie)
<br>
<br>

Still, I have to say that the art and music in the movie still goes really hard so at least that is something.
<br>
<br>

Susume notes:
<br>
<br>

I don't like the guy he looks weird
<br>
They seem to really care about locks here the animations go nasty
<br>
Lock picking lawyer would be proud
<br>
Ok the guy is gone let's go it's huge
<br>
This is huge for the christian community
<br>
Ok the music goes hard (13 minutes check, gives me nasty cowboy bebop vibes)
<br>
Holy he's a closer it's huge
<br>
Look up whisper of the heart
<br>
Wtf is a daijin
<br>
Mokoto shinkai once again hitting us with the nasty food animations

<br>

<br>

<br>
Ok so far this movie has been really schizo
<br>
Idk what is happening
<br>
Why are we supposed to just pretend like this daijin guy is a good person now like wtf scre him
<br>
Literally I would chuck him out of the car
<br>
Literally right now holy
<br>
Do it fast
<br>
The song goes not bad I though
<br>
Holy crap chuck the cat out
<br>
Oh they fucking - prozd 1:25:00
<br>
Oh they fucking for sure
<br>
Ok it's the sacrifice angle let's see it
<br>
wtf is happening
<br>
It fixed it's actually huge for the christian community
<br>
Ok I'm gonna be honest why tf is the woman just like into the guy after she saw him like for 5 he was literally a chair for the rest
<br>
of the move literally there's no way she's into chairs right there's no way I would say that she fell in love at first sight but
<br>
this ain't no 100 gf it doesn't make any sense
<br>
1:39:40 ok I heard the violins and I literally thought theme of mitsuha started playing and I got excited for 0
<br>
Ok so like he's been guiding us to this door right but like why tf he gotta turn the guy into a chair this makes no sense and he's
<br>
fricking dead too like it doesn't make any sense man wtf is happening I miss your name
<br>
Why tf are you in love with the guy I don't get it man why like you have to be into chairs it's the only explanation
<br>
Ok cat on worm action
<br>
Ok so like I get this is the place where she has been but like why tf do I care I don't care
<br>
My brothers in Christ he's literally a chair
<br>
Mf is gonna kill the entire world for a chair she's literally into the chair for 0
<br>
Ok daijin doing something good for once in his entirely miserable life
<br>
Ok she's gonna kiss the chair
<br>
Again
<br>
Let's see it
<br>
Ok b tech mitsuha theme hit me with it
<br>
Ok chair pov hit me with it
<br>
Man I don't care man I don't care
<br>
wtf do you mean finally met it's literally the first time you guys have met
<br>
wtf
<br>
Why though man
<br>
I feel like they have no reason to say these things like wanting to live and being alone because they aren't like they literally have
<br>
friends and stuff this feels so forced for 0
<br>
Ok works going up it's happening everyone's dying because this woman is into inanimate objects
<br>
How bout we don't flirt rn right when the worm is gonna leave
<br>
Bro I hope he's gonna die
<br>
Ok there we go he's gonna hit us with the self sacrifice angle let's we it
<br>
Ok worm's gonna go in let's see it rn
<br>
I really hope the worm goes full nuclear and the world ends
<br>
Prayge world obliteration angle
<br>
Man
<br>
This
<br>
Movie
<br>
Sucks
<br>
I think it's a 6/10 angle actually
<br>
Ok is she gonna tell him to do a chair cosplay is the question
<br>
Ohhhhhhh this thing
<br>
Ok sure
<br>
Time all happening at the same time sure but like why though
<br>
This feels so arbitrarily forced on us for no reason like why is this happening like why does this have anything to do with anything I
<br>
literally don't understand why she has to be the one to give the chair like why
<br>
Nvm I think this movie just have too much going on like if we just focused on the chair thing and maybe about suzumi being like
<br>
depressed about her mom dying and we go on some cool trip  and then she learn about like moving on
<br>
BRO THIS SPEECH LITERALLY MATCHES WHAT I WAS SAYING LITERALLY LIKE THAT SPEECH IS PERFEDT FOR WHAT I SAID LIKE WHY TF IS THE GUY HERE
<br>
FOR 0 AND WHY TF FUCK WE FIGHTING WORMS FOR 0
<br>
Ok thank goodness the guy and the woman didn't make out because if they did then we would have to see chair display
<br>
Ok are they gonna fuck
<br>
Oh they fucking
<br>
Please do not make out I don't want to see him dressed up as a yellow chair
<br>
I don't know what she sees in him
<br>
You know what
<br>
This has to be a hidden ad for 100 gf because nothing other than a zing explains her being so down bad for a chair
<br>
This ending song goes hard though
<br>
Ok the recorder going crazy let's see it
<br>
Radwimps the goat goes hard
<br>
Oh no
<br>
Not the chair
<br>
Don't
<br>
Please
<br>
I don't get it man
<br>
I don't
<br>
<br>
Ok I'm gonna be honest the only good parts of this movie was the nasty art and 3 nasty songs otherwise this movie kinda blows
Yea this movie sucky omega hard
<br>
<br>


Also side note this angry birds world tour lobby music goes kinda hard
<br>
<br>

Ok like i feel like i should not get flamed for moving my chair back like everyone can do it I don't know why I'm being flamed for 0
<br>
<br>

Literally the guy in front of me have it all the way down and you don't see me complaining
<br>
<br>

No joke if you have a problem just ask me and it's lit but he's just flaming me behind for 0
<br>
<br>
<br>



Ok so like if you somehow was able to sit through all that I really gotta congradulate you for that&#127775;
