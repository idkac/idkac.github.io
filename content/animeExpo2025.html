  <h3>idkac Anime Expo Shenanigans 2: Electric Boogaloo</h3>
  
  <p class='paragraph'>
      
    I decided to go to Anime Expo this year as well, with <b>2</b> of my friends this time, instead of just one (specifically my goats kjason and conservemomenta). If you know from my previous blog, you would have known that I was kinda pissed that I didn't get to see everything last year, so I got myself full 4 day pass this year, just so I can see everything. 
  
    </p>
    
  
  <p class = "paragraph">
      
    Contrary to how I wrote my blog last year, I'm actually going to do a brief summary of each day, talk a little about what happened, and then do a more indepth talk.

      
      For this anime expo, I mostly had the following as part of my bucket list

      
      <ol>
        
        <li> Go through the entire artist alley so I dont miss anything </li>
        
        <li> Take pictures with characters that I liked, specifically (in no particular order):
            
          <ul>
              
              <li> Hina </li>
              
              <li> Neru </li>
              
              <li> Nozomi and Hikari </li>
              
              <li> Kisaki </li>
              
              <li> Aru </li>
              
              <li> Yuuka </li>
              
              <li> Furina </li>
              
              <li> Hutao </li>
              
              <li> Don Quixote </li>
              
              <li> Roland </li>
            
            </ul>
        
          </li>
        
        <li> Get merch of the following franchises:
            
          <ul>
              
              <li> Blue Archive </li>
              
              <li> Library of Ruina </li>
              
              <li> Her Summon/One Room (a man can dream) </li>
            
            </ul>
        
          </li>
        
        <li> Get pictures with Gigguk (the goat) </li>
      
      </ol>

      
      <p class="footnote"> yea thats about it </p>

  <h3>Day 1, July 3rd</h3>
  
  <p class = "paragraph">
      
    First day was pretty chill. Mostly just went to the artist alley and explored the convention a bit. Conservemomenta wasn't actually here today, so it was just me and kjason going around. 

      
      <br>
      
      <br>

      
      The first thing that I did was go to the Blue Archive Dev Panel, which was pretty cool. I won't really go into details here because I wrote a whole detailed section on it below, so if you care you can scroll down and read it.

      
      <br>
      
      <br>

      
      The next thing that I did was just walk around the artist alley, because the one thing that I was really unhappy about last year was that I missed out on like 70% of the artist alley, and I had to speedrun on the last day running through all the stands to try and find Project Moon merch. Other than that nothing really happened today, just a lot of walking.

      
      <br>
      
      <br>

      
      And as is tradition, heres the photo dump of the day with all the cosplayers.

  </p>

  
  <p class="paragraph">
    
    For Thursday, the plan was to check out the stalls that anime expo had, so stuff like Good Smile Company, Mihoyo, Crunchyroll, etc.
    
  </p>

    
    <p class="footnote">
      
      (unfortunately blue archive did not have a stand this year, which kinda sucked)
    
    </p>

    
    <br>

    
    <p class="paragraph">
      
      The first stand of note was the Gundam Stand, which I think was to promote the new card game that they were making. They had a full sized gundam on display which was really cool:

      
      <br>
      
      <br>

      
      And as tradition, we had to go to the Omocat stand, which had the same merch as always and also the new merch that came out. They also had the actual Omori manga for sale as well, which was pretty cool. 

      
      <br>
      
      <br>

      
      One notable thing was that they were selling Saba merch (yes the gawr gura saba), which is like generational turnaround time because its only been like 5 days since her debut. (speed of light vs. r34 artists when a new character comes out)
      
    </p>

      
      <p class="footnote">
        
        to be fair omocat probably got some insider info on the saba design, but its still hilarious (and also there were a lot of saba merch at the artist alley as well, which is also crazy). 
          
        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        I literally saw someone walking around in the same omocat saba merch that day, which means that in the <b>5 days</b> since saba debuted, there has already been content and merch being created around her
      
      </p>

      
      <br>

      
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        So the next thing that was pretty cool was the Umamusume stand, which just had the global launch. I actually very recently discovered Umamusume, because I was heavily invested in Horse Race Tests (Cyan my goat), and by extension I learned what Umamusume is. 
        
      </p>

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        <p class="footnote">
          
          Technically im not like a huge fan of the game, or the overall ip for that matter, but I do think the game is really cool and am thinking of playing it at some point.
        
        </p>

        
        <br>

        
        <p class="paragraph">
        
          But yea, they had 2 full sized stands of the characters in the game, which was really cool. 

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        I also want to take this time to talk about some funny images that I found for the game, aka glueless and goldless (both of which are really funny).
        
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        I also happened to get a picture with this really swole Miku:
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        There was this one stand with a manga distribution company, and they had on display some of the mangas that they had on this giant wall. If you don't really look at the actual mangas it's like whatever, but then you take a closer look and you will see the most diabolical 3 mangas on display of all time. 
      </p>

      <p class="footnote">
        If you know you know

        <br>
        <br>

        Technically The Summer that Hikaru Died is not the worst thing of all time, but its still got body horror and its a yaoi... sooooooo 
        <!-- TODO: THINKIES -->
      </p>
        
      <p class="paragraph">

        There was also a stand for Aniplex that was celebrating their 20th anniversary, and they had a bunch of artists draw celebration prints, and some of these series are pretty cool, and some are more questionable
        <!-- TODO: THINKIES -->

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">

        Here's some pictures of the cars that people had on display outside:

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        I got this picture with a Mundo cosplayer, courtesy of Alois:

      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        I don't remember which company this was for, but they had on display a art wall that people could draw on, mostly for Miku, and it was actually pretty cool to see what people drew, as well as all the inside jokes and different art styles.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        I even added my own little drawing of Liar Dancer to the wall (which personally I think is one of the best Teto songs of all time)
      </p>

      <p class="footnote">
        So I'm gonna get a little political here, so if you don't like or want to read that you can just skip this part. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Basically if you look at the top left of the picture, you can see like a really big drawing of a guy in black with the words "Free Gaza" next to it, which by itself is like whatever, because I don't want to get into the whole political aspect of the message and everything (this is mainly just a little blog site where I get to gush about animes and mangas so I don't wanna get into it). My main problem is the guy who drew it decided to draw over the rest of the artwork that were under it (some of which were very high effort).

        <br>
        <br>

        First of all, this is not the place for you to do your political messaging, its a fricking wall for people to share their passion about vocaloids. Ain't no one here wants to see you butting in with your political messages, regardless of if they are good or bad (once again, the message does not matter here, because I really dont care). 

        <br>
        <br>

        Like sure ok, do whatever you want with your political activism, but let's have at least a little public decency to not draw over other people's work. It's not like they did anything to you, and now you're just being a giant bum.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        But yea, idk, something about it just left a really sour taste in my mouth.
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Well, now that that's out of the way, we can go back to our scheduled programming, which is just idkac walking around for more pictures with cosplayers.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Here's a picture of me with chef from South Park:
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Here's a picture of me with Spring Trap, which I think was part of a promotional thing that was happening with Dead By Daylight.

        <p class="footnote">
          Btw here's a really funny/sick edit of Spring Trap on twitter:

          <!-- TODO: Now the big question is can i actually find that edit -->
        </p>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        So remember how one of my goals this Anime Expo was to find/meet Gigguk? Well turns out he's doing a panel with Trash Taste for Honkai Star Rail (which I think is actually a yearly thing that they do at AX now). So obviously I decided to line up outside the stadium where the panel was going to be about 2 hours before it even started. 

        <br>
        <br>

        By the time that the panel was about to start, the line was already stretching out for (probably) a whole mile, so I was really glad that I stood in line early (although my legs were not very happy, as I had to stand the entire time while waiting)

        <br>
        <br>

        Unfortunately the whole panel was kinda just a fake QNA, and there really wasn't any meet and greet setup, so it wasn't as hype as I thought it would be. But still, heres the photo dump for what I took for the panel
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        For dinner, I saw that there was a pretty highly reviewed soul food restaurant nearby, so I decided to stop there for food, and heres the pictures of what I got:
      </p>

      <p class="footnote">
        Their fried chicken was actually pretty good
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Oh yea btw, the next part is also going to be a bit 18+, so Imma just put it at the end of the blog, so you won't have to look at it if you dont wanna
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
        So after this, I went to the late night Fakku panel where they were holding a QNA session with Asanagi-sensei (if you know you know). This panel was actually really really fun, as the panel was not a fake QNA like the HSR one, but instead was an actual QNA where people from the audience lined up to ask questions to Asanagi-sensei (I also happened to know a good chunk of the content that he makes, so that made it a lot funnier as well, since I got a bunch of the "inside joke" questions that people asked)

        <br>
        <br>

        Also, apparently this panel was like the first time that Asanagi has ever done a QNA, or (maybe?) showed his face in person, so obviously (and unfortunately) recording and photo imagery were not allowed in the panel. He was also drawing the front page of the next doujinshi that he was going to sell at the Summer Comiket on screen as like a form of subway surfers, so he probably didn't want that to be leaked as well. This also means that I do not have any pictures of the panel because I am a good boy and a law abiding citizen. Instead, I wrote some some notes of the funniest parts of the QNA:

        <ol>
          <li> Someone asked: "Why do you keep drawing girls with horns and they always end up being broken in the end
            <ul>
              <li> Asanagi: It's because the horns are the clitoris of the head <!--TODO: OMEGALUL -->
                 </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li> One of the questions that was asked was about what Asanagi's favorite type of scene to draw was, and his response was "squirting" in japanese. The problem was that the translator that we had didn't know what squirting meant so he had no idea how to translate it. So him and Asanagi's manager (who also happened to be there) spent like 2 minutes on google translate trying to figure it out. 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Asanagi, who got (understandably) impatient, then decided to just draw the scene on his screen, and everyone just started cheering. (Someone also did a soyface to it) <!-- TODO: Soyface -->
          </li>

          <li> I also happened to sneak a little question in for the boys, which was "what's a series that you haven't wrote a work for that you want to write next"
            <ul>
              <li> To which he answered: BLUE ARCHIVEEEEEEEEEEE </li>
              <p class="footnote"> to be fair i think hes done like really short works for blue archive already, so maybe he means like a full doujinshi</p>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li> This question wasn't aimed at Asanagi, but basically a guy asked the director of Fakku how he's going to handle new legislations that are passed/trying to be passed that are going to restrict 18+ content around the world. And specifically, he said (and these are his exact words) "I still want to goon in the future. I like your goon please make more."
          </li>

          <li> So remember how Asanagi was drawing the cover art for his next doujin, halfway through the panel he started coloring in the art. One of the characters had a bra on and when he started coloring it in, he used the iconic &#58636; &#58636; &#58636; RED WHITE AND BLUE &#58636; &#58636; &#58636; 

          </li>


        </ol>

      </p>


        

      
        <h3> Day 3, July 5th </h3>

        
      <p class="paragraph">
        
          So apparently cosplay gatherings were a thing, because I had 0 idea last year (and I probably missed out on a blue archive cosplay gathering as a result). So this year I made sure that I wouldn't miss out, and the first one that I went to was the Project Moon cosplay gathering (which was actually surprisingly quite big)

        
        <!-- TODO: ADD PICTURES OF PROJECT MOON HERE -->

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        After that, I had some down time to just walk around, so I got some more cool pictures. 

        
        I got this picture with Miku and Akagame Rin, which was pretty cool:

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        I also got this picture with the literal fortress from Howl's Moving Castle:

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        Heres a picture of me with 2 Mundos: 

        
        <br>
        
        <br>

        
        Probably one of the coolest pictures that I got today was this one with 2 Charlie cosplayers:

        
        <p class="footnote">
          
          This cosplay situation is insane
        
        </p>

        
        <br>
        
      </p>

        
        <p class="paragraph">
          
          Here's also a picture of a miku motorbike, which I thought was pretty cool:            

          
          <br>
          
          <br>

          
          Heres a picture of me with idkac Soraka:

          
          <br>
          
          <br>

          
          So after this, I decided to go get some lunch, and
