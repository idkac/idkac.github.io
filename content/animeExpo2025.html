    <h3>idkac Anime Expo Shenanigans 2: Electric Boogaloo</h3>
    <p class='paragraph'>
        So I decided to go to Anime Expo this year as well, with <b>2</b> of my friends this time, instead of just one (specifically my goats kjason and conservemomenta). If you know from my previous blog, you would have known that I was kinda pissed that I didn't get to see everything last year, so I got myself full 4 day pass this year, just so I can see everything.

    <p class = "paragraph">
        So contrary to how I wrote my blog last year, I'm actually going to do a brief summary of each day, talk a little about what happened, and then do (specifically 2) more indepth talks.

    <h3>Day 1, July 3rd</h3>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        So first day was pretty chill. Mostly just went to the artist alley and explored the convention a bit. Conservemomenta wasn't actually here today, so it was just me and kjason going around.
