    <h3>idkac Anime Expo Shenanigans 2: Electric Boogaloo</h3>
    <p class='paragraph'>
        I decided to go to Anime Expo this year as well, with <b>2</b> of my friends this time, instead of just one (specifically my goats kjason and conservemomenta). If you know from my previous blog, you would have known that I was kinda pissed that I didn't get to see everything last year, so I got myself full 4 day pass this year, just so I can see everything. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "paragraph">
        Contrary to how I wrote my blog last year, I'm actually going to do a brief summary of each day, talk a little about what happened, and then do a more indepth talk.

        For this anime expo, I mostly had the following as part of my bucket list

        <ol>
          <li> Go through the entire artist alley so I dont miss anything </li>
          <li> Take pictures with characters that I liked, specifically (in no particular order):
              <ul>
                <li> Hina </li>
                <li> Neru </li>
                <li> Nozomi and Hikari </li>
                <li> Kisaki </li>
                <li> Aru </li>
                <li> Yuuka </li>
                <li> Furina </li>
                <li> Hutao </li>
                <li> Don Quixote </li>
                <li> Roland </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Get merch of the following franchises:
              <ul>
                <li> Blue Archive </li>
                <li> Library of Ruina </li>
                <li> Her Summon/One Room (a man can dream) </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Get pictures with Gigguk (the goat) </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="footnote"> yea thats about it </p>

    <h3>Day 1, July 3rd</h3>
    <p class = "paragraph">
        First day was pretty chill. Mostly just went to the artist alley and explored the convention a bit. Conservemomenta wasn't actually here today, so it was just me and kjason going around. 

        <br>
        <br>

        The first thing that I did was go to the Blue Archive Dev Panel, which was pretty cool. I won't really go into details here because I wrote a whole detailed section on it below, so if you care you can scroll down and read it.

        <br>
        <br>

        The next thing that I did was just walk around the artist alley, because the one thing that I was really unhappy about last year was that I missed out on like 70% of the artist alley, and I had to speedrun on the last day running through all the stands to try and find Project Moon merch. Other than that nothing really happened today, just a lot of walking.

        <br>
        <br>

        And as is tradition, heres the photo dump of the day with all the cosplayers.

    <p class="paragraph">
      For Thursday, the plan was to check out the stalls that anime expo had, so stuff like Good Smile Company, Mihoyo, Crunchyroll, etc.


      <p class="footnote">
        (unfortunately blue archive did not have a stand this year, which kinda sucked)
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="paragraph">
        The first stand of note was the Gundam Stand, which I think was to promote the new card game that they were making. They had a full sized gundam on display which was really cool:

        <br>
        <br>

        And as tradition, we had to go to the Omocat stand, which had the same merch as always and also the new merch that came out. They also had the actual Omori manga for sale as well, which was pretty cool. 

        <br>
        <br>

        One notable thing was that they were selling Saba merch (yes the gawr gura saba), which is like generational turnaround time because its only been like 5 days since her debut. (speed of light vs. r34 artists when a new character comes out)

        <p class="footnote">
          to be fair omocat probably got some insider info on the saba design, but its still hilarious (and also there were a lot of saba merch at the artist alley as well, which is also crazy). 
          
          <br>
          <br>

          I literally saw someone walking around in the same omocat saba merch that day, which means that in the <b>5 days</b> since saba debuted, there has already been content and merch being created around her
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">
          So the next thing that was pretty cool was the Umamusume stand, which just had the global launch. I actually very recently discovered Umamusume, because I was heavily invested in Horse Race Tests (Cyan my goat), and by extension I learned what Umamusume is. 

          <br>
          <br>

          <p class="footnote">
            Technically im not like a huge fan of the game, or the overall ip for that matter, but I do think the game is really cool and am thinking of playing it at some point.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p class="paragraph">
          But yea, they had 2 full sized stands of the characters in the game, which was really cool. 

          <br>
          <br>

          I also want to take this time to talk about some funny images that I found for the game, aka glueless and goldless (both of which are really funny).

          <br>
          <br>

          So apparently cosplay gatherings were a thing, because I had 0 idea last year (and I probably missed out on a blue archive cosplay gathering as a result). So this year I made sure that I wouldn't miss out, and the first one that I went to was the Project Moon cosplay gathering (which was actually surprisingly quite big)
