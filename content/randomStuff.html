   <h3>Random thoughts for the week</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
    It's spooky season <img src = "https://images.emojiterra.com/google/android-12l/512px/1f383.png" alt = "spooky" class = "footnoteImage"> so UCLA held a Halloween haunted mansion event. 
    It was video games themed so they had some pretty cool stuff like Silent Hill, Last of Us, and Five Nights at Freddy's. The event was overall really fun and the props they had at the 
    haunted mansion were extremely high quality. 

    <br><br>

    But obviously in true idkac fashion we are not here to get scared, so I decided to do some trolling instead. 

    <br><br>

    So the idea that I devised was simply to walk up to every single person in the haunted mansion (and I do mean every single one of them) and I am going to ask them for a picture. 
    This way I get to act goofy and ask for pictures and I also get to break out of the emersion at the same time and not get scared.

    <br><br>

    So here is the obligatory photo dump of the event where I took pictures with almost every single person in the haunted hill while looking like the goofiest person alive.

    <p class = "paragraph">

        This one is probably my favorite image:
        <div id = "table" align = "center">
            <img src="/assets/images/randomThoughts/halloween7.JPG" title="Halloween 7" width="350px"> 
        </div>
        <p class = "footnote">
            You can just see my friends running for their lives away from the guy and I am just the dumb stupid one squatting down like grinning like an idiot trying to take a picture.
        </p>

    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        But yea my only complaint is that one of the guys refused to take a picture with me and instead try to walk away as fast as possible which was very cringe. Otherwise it was a very fun experience.

        <br><br>

        Also side note I was at my dining hall and I saw a guy wearing a <a href = "https://futaroku.gg/products/2023-world-champions-t1-t-shirt" class = "links">T1 Worlds 2023 shirt</a>, which was sick af.
        <div id = "table" align = "center">
            <img src="/assets/images/randomThoughts/t1.JPG" title="T1 Fighting" width="350px"> 
        </div>

    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Which is a great segway to my talk about how T1 BLG is this Saturday and how it would be absolutely insane for T1 to win a 5th trophy in a row like that is actually insanity if it actually happens. Like 
        bro if you told me 3 years ago that this absolute degenerate of a roster that is ZOFGK was going to go back to back wins and make 3 worlds finals I would have laughed you out of the room. Like bro they lost
        to KT (WHO LOST TO FRICKING NONSHIM). This truly is T1's world and we are just living in it. 

        <br><br>

        Anyways heres a dump of some funny t1 memes:

        <div id = "table" align = "center">

        </div>

        <p class = "paragraph">
            Game 3 in a nutshell:
                <div id = "table" align = "center">

        <br><br>

        <p class = "paragraph">
            But yea that's about it for me today. Not sure when I am going to update this website in the future but I think I have a few things planned. Hopefully t1 wins again this Saturday because that will 
            actually be crazy hamburgers.
