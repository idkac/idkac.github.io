   <h1>Written Aug 19</h1>
   <h3>Some random thoughts on a idkac's manga/manhua/manhwa of the week</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
     It's been a while since I've written anything on this website.

     <br>

     So here's a short little spiel about this

        <a class='links' href='https://mangadex.org/title/17a56d33-9443-433a-9e0d-70459893ed8f/my-wife-is-from-a-thousand-years-ago?tab=art'>manhua</a>

     I've been reading since (yesterday)
     </p>

     <p class = "footnote">Ok I'm gonna be honest I tried doing a synopsis and I realized I am completely dogwater at doing a synopsis so I'm just going to copy paste the one from mangadex.</p>

     <br>

     <blockquote>
       Jiang He, a girl from the Tang Dynasty, traveled through a thousand years and appeared in front of Xu Qing. Fate brought together this love that spanned a thousand years. Everything the girl was familiar with has become history. Relatives, friends, and enemies have all been left behind 1,200 years ago. The boy is unreserved and leads the girl to start a new life. Pain, confusion, cheers, and laughter will remain in this new world.
    </blockquote>

    <p class = "footnote">Wow pretty cool huh</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Ok well regardless manhua is pretty much your run of the mill romance manhua/manga that is just executed pretty well and isn't dragged out (which holy crap is so hard to find nowadays)
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Now normally I would have just kept quiet about this manga (because there really isn't much to talk about) and eventually uploaded a short review onto my MAL (which I am not sharing for obvious reasons). The reason I am writing a post about this is
      <ol>
        <li>Practice doing pictures in html (you'll see why in a moment) and
          <li>Talking about the goat (Jiang He (FMC))</li>
          </ol>

    <p class = "footnote">
      If you are curious I am currently about 150 chapters in 1 day into reading (its a pretty short read).
      </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      So here's a picture of her:
      </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src ="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/IMG_6886.png" alt="the goat in question" title="the goat in question" width="20%" class="center">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      Wow very poggers
      </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      So the reason I am bringing her up is because Jiang He looks suspiciously close to Serika from Blue Archive (yes the gacha game). They are both female (wow), have black hair, red eyes, and are tsunderes (the goat). And the author also likes to draw Jiang He with cat ears whenever she's flustered, and the resemblance to Serika is quite uncanny.

      <br>
      <br>

      Here's a side by side comparison:

    <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/jianghe1.png" title = "jianghe1" width = "267px">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/serika_2.jpg" title = "serika1" style = "width: 267px; height: 253px; object-fit: cover; object-position: 0 10%">
    </div>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
    And here's another one:

    <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/jianghe3.png" title = "jianghe2" style = "width: 267px; height: 253px; object-fit: cover">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/serika_blush.jpeg" title = "serika2" style = "width: 267px; height: 253px; object-fit: cover; object-position: 0 10%">
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
    And here's another Jiang He for the funsies:
    <div style = "text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/jianghe2.png" title = "jianghe3" width = "22.3%">
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      But yea just thought this was a pretty funny coincidence that I wanted to share. The manhua itself is actually a pretty fun read, just standard wholesome romance stuff. It also has some really funny jokes like Zhong Kui and this April Fool's joke:
      </p>
    <div id="table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/lefunnytroll.png" title = "letroll1" width = "253px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/lefunnytroll2.png" title = "letroll2" style = "width: 253px; height: 286px; object-fit: cover;">
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      And to end off this blog I have this one last troll from the manhua which actually got me, so I guess it makes it extra funny:
      </p>

    <div style = "text-align: center;">
      <img src="/assets/images/coolCharacterImages/screwyoubro.png" title = "screw you bro" width = "50%">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      I ain't young btw, I am a ripe old age of 19 (at the time of writing this).
      </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Oh btw just wanted to do an update on this, I am now 200-ish chapters in and holy crap this is the goat. I wouldn't say that this is 10/10 material but its definately in contension for 9/10 (which is monsterously high in idkac's standards)
      </p>

    <p class = "footnote">
      It's a shame this doesn't exist on MAL, because I would have 100% added it like holy bazinga (I can't believe I just typed the word bazinga).
      </p>

    <br>

    <p class paragraph = "paragraph">
      Ok update I am now officially up to date and loly crap its actually the goat like 9/10 for sure

      <br>
