   <h3>Some random thoughts on a idkac's manga/manhua/manhwa of the week</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
     It's been a while since I've written anything on this website.

     <br>

     So here's a short little spiel about this
     <a class='links' href='https://mangadex.org/title/17a56d33-9443-433a-9e0d-70459893ed8f/my-wife-is-from-a-thousand-years-ago?tab=art'>manhua</a>
     I've been reading since (yesterday)

     <br>
<p class = "footnote">Ok I'm gonna be honest I tried doing a synopsis and I realized I am completely dogwater at doing a synopsis so I'm just going to copy paste the one from mangadex.</p>

     </p>
     <blockquote>
Jiang He, a girl from the Tang Dynasty, traveled through a thousand years and appeared in front of Xu Qing. Fate brought together this love that spanned a thousand years. Everything the girl was familiar with has become history. Relatives, friends, and enemies have all been left behind 1,200 years ago. The boy is unreserved and leads the girl to start a new life. Pain, confusion, cheers, and laughter will remain in this new world.
