  <h3>Random Thoughts on Mangas I Read in the Last Month</h3>
  <p class='paragraph'>
    So I don't really have any plans on what exactly I'm gonna write about, mostly just have a few mangas in mind that I really wanted to talk about.

    <br>

    <h2>Manga 1: <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/manga/146211/Marriagetoxin">Marriagetoxin</a></h2>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      So here's the synopsis:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A hitman and a marriage swindler set out on the world's most grueling battle for marriage! Gero is a young man from a clan of hitmen, which has been in existence for hundreds of years. As someone who's never gone to school and lived his life dealing in the dark side of the business, he considers himself to have "no prospects with women" and marriage as "something not for him." However, one day, in fear that their lineage would dissolve, his clan warns Gero that if he doesn't marry and produce an heir, they would have no choice but to...force his little sister into doing "that." Driven to his wits' end, Gero asks the target of his work, a marriage swindler, to...
    </blockquote>
    
    <p class = "footnote">
      Basically a shounen manga but the mc wants to get laid
    </p>

    <br>

  <p class = "paragraph">
    Now if you were thinking how this synopsis was kinda stupid, you would be right, because the manga is kinda goofy at times. 

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Like this is a panel that exists in the manga:
    </p>

    <div id = "table" align = "center">
      <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage.jpg" title = "Marriage" width = "550px">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      So true btw (reminds me of vagabound for some reason)
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Here's some more examples:

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/stupid3.jpg" title = "Stupid 3" width = "450px">
      </div>

      <p class = "footnote">
        just for clarification this is not the mc btw
      </p>

      <br>

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/stupid1.jpg" title = "Stupid 1" width = "450px">
      </div>

      <p class = "footnote">
        yes the picture is literally just dude using his bare feet to grip onto 2 motorcycles and spin them around
      </p>

      <br>

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/stupid2.jpg" title = "Stupid 2" width = "550px">
      </div>

      <p class = "footnote">
        I'm not even gonna try to explain the context behind this one
      </p>
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Now the thing is if this manga was just a gag manga it would have been perfectly fine, cuz it would just be another banger like <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/manga/123681/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo">100 girlfriends</a> (the goat btw), but nooooo the author
      decided to also make the manga's action absolutely disgustingly good.

      <br>
      <br>

      Also I need to mention how absolutely gorgeous all the art in this manga is. Like HOLY CRAP THE AUTHOR DID NOT NEED TO COOK THIS HARD

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage1.jpg" title = "Marriage 1" width = "550px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage2.jpg" title = "Marriage 2" width = "550px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage5.jpeg" title = "Marriage 5" width = "450px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage3.jpg" title = "Marriage 3" width = "450px">
      </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      Like bro this art goes too crazy
    </p>
  </p>

  <p class = "paragraph">
    I think the best comparison that I can make with this manga would probably be DanDaDan (which also goes monster hard btw), since both are basically battle shounens that are very goofy and often do not take themself very seriously and also happen to have really really good art. 

    <br>
    <br>

    Currently based on what I have read (which is every chapter that has been released) I would give this like a high 8 - low 9 (i have a 9 on my mal rn), which is subject to change depending on how the author finishes this manga and who wins (which is the more important thing obviously). The manga has really fricking good 
    art, the characters (imo) are all based (especially my goat the bug user), and the story is pretty lit. I am honestly kinda surprised that not many people has heard of this manga, and I am kinda looking forward to the day this gets adapted into an anime, cuz I think that would go really hard (just look at how dandadan turned out). 
    
    <br>
    <br>

    But yea currently there is 6 potential candidates for my goat Gero and I would honestly be fine if he ends up with any of them, so we've even got the idkac curse handled. Here is a picture of all 6 of them btw:
    
    <div id = "table" align = "center">
      <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/marriage4.jpg" title = "Marriage 4" width = "450px">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      (I'm fine with all of them winning except probably Shiori (sorry), but surely she doesnt win right<img src = "../assets/images/clueless.png" alt = "clueless" class = "footnoteImage">)
      <br>
      there's also a secret dark horse pick (Kinosaki) but I don't think that's gonna happen based on how the manga has been set up<img src = "../assets/images/clueless.png" alt = "clueless" class = "footnoteImage">
    </p>
    </p>
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>Manga 2: <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/manga/142799/Goukon_ni_Ittara_Onna_ga_Inakatta_Hanashi">How I Attended an All-Guy's Mixer</a></h2>
  <p class = "footnote">
    I can explain
  </p>

  <p class = "paragraph">
    I know you can kinda tell by the title what this manga's gonna be about but here's the synopsis anyways:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    College student Tokiwa gets invited to a mixer by his female classmate Suo. But when he arrives with his friends, they're greeted by three dazzlingly handsome men?!
  </blockquote>

  <p class = "footnote">
    kinda doesn't help
  </p>

  <br>

  <p class = "paragraph">
    So first thing's first, this manga is not a yaoi, but rather its a normal (or as normal as you can be with this type of setup) romance manga between 3 dudes and 3 girls. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Now to address the elephant in the room: yes the fmcs most of the time are crossdressing (aka they look like men), but is that going to stop me from liking the characters and find them attractive (not really? I don't think I'm gay but idk what this says about me). 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    To summarize my thoughts when I read this manga, here's a picture from the manga for reference:

    <div id = "table" align = "center">
      <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/gay1.jpg" title = "Gay 1" width = "450px">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
      Kohaku the goat btw
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      But yea that aside this manga is actually quite good. I think the story is actually really well paced and the characters clearly have a lot of chemistry together, which makes the manga very enjoyable. The art also (as always with the manga that I talk about here) goes mega hard.

      <br>
      <br>

      They also have chibis which look very cool:

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/gay2.jpg" title = "Gay 2" style = "width: 450px; height: 366px; object-fit: cover;">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/gay3.jpg" title = "Gay 3" width = "450px">
      </div>
    </p>
    
    <p class = "paragraph">
      But yea that is about it for this manga, not much else to say about it. I guess I will mention that I gave this a 9/10 on my mal, which is a monster score (which also means that you should read it cuz it goes hard).
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Manga 3: <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/manga/165876/Houkago_Kitaku_Biyori">Houkago Kitaku Biyori</a></h2>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Here is the synopsis:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Shun was invited to the Going-Home Club by Naoki Satou, also known as "Chokki-chan". Despite refusing, he ends up being somewhat forcefully involved in the club's activities! A Going Home Club rom-com featuring a detour-loving high school girl and a new high school student who has lost his dream.
    </blockquote>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      So this one's gonna be pretty short. The manga is basically just a straight forward romcom slice of life, and it really doesn't do anything too special. But what I will say is that it does the basics really well, and it doesn't go out of its way to do something weird or out of the box just so the manga "different" 

      <br>
      <br>

      However, this itself is not enough for me to actually write a blog about it, so here's what really stood out in this manga for me:

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/handholding1.PNG" title = "Handholding 1" width = "450px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/handholding2.PNG" title = "Handholding 2" width = "450px">
      </div>

      <p class = "footnote">
        Yep that's it 

        <br>
        <br>

        <img src = "https://media1.tenor.com/m/7UarUv_Z1QYAAAAd/gunna-fire.gif" alt = "absolute cinema" width = "50px">
      </p>
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      As you know, I have read a lot of romance mangas (and I do mean A LOT), and in basically every single one of those mangas they'll have to do an obligatory handholding scene. Most of the time it's just them like walking somewhere and the mc will awkwardly reach out his hand and boom that's it. 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      This manga is the only one that I have seen do something different, and the author really cooked with it. It's short, not overblown with random thoughts from either the mc or the fmc, and most importantly it's really fricking wholesome. Now you might say that this doesn't seem to be that big of a deal, and you are probably right. But damn 
      did these 2 panels hit hard when I first saw it. 
      
      <p class = "footnote">
        The fact that I even decided to write a part of a blog about this panel should speak volumes. 
      </p>
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Manga 4: <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/manga/129759/Isekai_Mokushiroku_Mynoghra__Hametsu_no_Bunmei_de_Hajimeru_Sekai_Seifuku">Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra: Hametsu no Bunmei de Hajimeru Sekai Seifuku</a></h2>

    <p class = "footnote">
      Based on the title length alone you can tell it's an isekai (also last one i promise)
    </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      Here's the synopsis:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Bedridden and abandoned, Takuto Ira spent his days in the hospital trying to beat the illness that was slowly killing him. His only solace lay in the nation management strategy game Eternal Nations, where he had built a reputation as the greatest player to ever live. After succumbing to his disease, Takuto awoke within the game next to Atou-the Hero unit for his favorite civilization, Mynoghra. Now they'll set out to conquer the world together (again), one unit, settlement, and level at a time!
    </blockquote>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
      So I've been on a binge-fest recently where I specifically read mangas from the oddly specific genre of "kingdom building isekais", and this was one of the manga's I found during this binge. I will say that this was probably the most unique concept out of all the mangas I've read in this genre, and it is quite the shame that there aren't any more
      mangas with a similar setting (which is kinda weird considering that rts is not even that unpopular). 

      <br>
      <br>

      The actual manga is pretty alright, and I found the overall experience quite enjoyable (although the recent chapters have been quite schizo and hard to follow). I think the way that rts was incorporated into the kingdom building theme was really interesting and was a nice twist to this genre. The inclusion of other game types and how they
      affect the world was also quite interesting, especially the idea of unskippable cutscenes in rpgs (although I will say that the way they introduced this was quite unnecessary and also very cringe). There is also the complaint of very very slow releases, which is also kinda cringe but it is what it is. 

      <br>
      <br>

      With that out of the way, the main reason that I brought up this manga was once again because of a few panels within a chapter:

      <div id = "table" align = "center">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/rts1.PNG" title = "RTS 1" width = "350px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/rts2.PNG" title = "RTS 2" width = "350px">
        <img src="/assets/images/randomMangaStuff/rts3.PNG" title = "RTS 3" width = "350px">
      </div>
      
      <p class = "footnote">
        Not much to say except that this goes really hard
      </p>
    </p>


    <p class = "paragraph">
      But yea that is about it for this blog, not sure when I'm gonna drop another blog (probably when another manga piques my interest). Happy holidays and have a great New Year.

    WE'RE POWERSPIKING NOW MY GOAT KOHAKU STAYS WINNING (I literally waited for like a whole 2 months for this chapter to update (59) and we get the fricking update ON VALENTINES DAY OF ALL DAYS AND ITS FRICKING CRAZY (Im still getting jebaited by the ending but still its actually like peak.))
