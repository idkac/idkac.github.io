    <h2>Written 10/17/2024</h2>
   <h3>Been a while since I've wrote one of these huh</h3>
   
   <p class='paragraph'>
    So let me prefice this by saying that I have not read a manga in a good while. Any by a good while I mean I have not read a manga in like two weeks, which is basically a year in idkac years.
    So this was a pretty momentous occassion if I do say so myself. 
   </p>

    <br>
    
   <p class='paragraph'>
    The manga that I will be talking about today is 
    <a class='links' href='https://myanimelist.net/manga/162964/Mayonaka_Heart_Tune?q=tune%20&cat=manga'>Mayonaka Heart Tune</a>
    or Tune In to the Midnight Heart.

    <br>
    <br>

    The synopsis is as follows 
    <blockquote>
    When Arisu Yamabuki was all alone in bed at night, he was able to find solace in the voice of a radio host who went by "Apollo." However, one day, she simply stopped broadcasting without any explanation. Years then passed, and Arisu is now a second-year high-schooler. He makes it his mission to search for Apollo, as there is something he wants to tell her. He doesn't know what she looks like, or even what her real name is, but he manages to get some leads on her in his school's broadcasting club. That's where he meets four girls who all dream to get a job where they can make full use of their voices! Just who is Apollo, and how will those four's dreams pan out?
    </blockquote>

    <p class='paragraph'>
    Here's the thing, if you know anything about me you would know that the idkac curse exists, and that curse is the literal bane of my existance
    when it comes to me reading romance mangas. And by the way this synopsis is written out you can tell in a heart beat that I am going to not have a good
    time reading this manga. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Not because I am not going to enjoy reading this manga or anything, mostly because I am going to have 10 mental breakdowns when the girl I like is not going to win (because lets be honest here,
    we know that my goat is not going to win because the idkac curse exists).

    <p class='footnote'>
        A guy can dream though.

        So a little bit more about this manga: the art goes absolutely crazy. I have read some mangas with some disgustingly good art and this manga definately goes
        up there in terms of quality. Like bro my brother in christ the author did not need to cook this hard.

        The manga also have some really funny panels as well, and I really love how the artist has chibi-fied versions of every single character (some of them are really goofy).

        also the goat.

    <p class = "paragraph">
        If you haven't noticed by now I really like all the characters, because the author did a really fricking good job at making the charcters likeable and relatable (and holy crap Nene is the goat 
        have I mentioned that I dont think I have).

        <br>
        <br>

        I may have some preferences, but all 4 of the characters are really nice and they are all goated (except for maybe Rikka she's alright). (Still want Nene to win though).

    <br>

    <h2>Why Nene is the goat</h2>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        So I guess if we were going by an argumentative essay kinda format I've given my thesis so now I have to provide supporting evidence on why Nene is the absolute goat. 

        <br>
        <br>

        First, lets just get the fact that Nene is a tsundere out of the way, because that right up my alley. I also really like Nene's design (TWINTAILS) and she is the cause of many of the funniest panels that has 
        happened in this manga:
    </p>

        <img src="/assets/images/tune-into-the-midnight-heart/nene-the-goat.jpg" title="Nene the Goat 1" height = "557px">
        <img src="/assets/images/tune-into-the-midnight-heart/nene-the-goat2.jpg" title="Nene the Goat 2" width = "450px">
    </div>

    <p class = "footnote">
        The absolute GOAT
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        Additionally, I think that Nene's development throughout the manga is probably the best, and she is also the most vocal in terms of displaying her feelings for Arisu (kinda like my other goat Nino (the GOAT)).
        It was really fun seeing her development over the chapters and to see the different advances that she made towards our mc. Plus did I mention that she's a tsundere.

    <p class = "footnote">
        Like who would not want her to win bro shes just the goat
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        Theres was this fireworks arc where the whole myth is that if a girl and a boy sees the firework together they would fall in love and get in a relationship (the classic). And obviously all 4 girls are gonna want to see the 
        fireworks with Arisu. So we had this whole chapter just dedicated to the 4 of them trying to find Arisu so they can watch the fireworks together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Well guess who get's to watch it with him in the end?

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        That concludes my TED Talk on why Nene is the goat. But yea it has been a while since I have had felt the same sense of excitement since I first read Quints when I was a wee lad. This manga is really fricking good and if 
        my goat wins then I can likely (maybe) (probably not) bump this up to a 10 but we will have to see. All I'm saying is that as I read the manga I felt like I was being brought back to the early days of idkac when I was 
        browsing reddit reading theories and memes and being an avid part of the Church (not the religious type btw). Good times.  

        <br>
        <br>

        Something that I forgot to mention is that I really like how the chapters are named because they generally have something to do with how the chapter ends so its really fun to see the title and try to figure out what it means.
        (Real innovative I know).

        Pretty cool
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        Also kinda big spoiler but the current consensus in the subreddit is that Rikka is Apollo, which I persoanlly also believe, but I am going to cope that since Arisu doesn't know Apollo's identity even after he has married 
        that maybe (<img src = "../assets/images/clueless.png" alt = "clueless.png" class = "footnoteImage"></a>) Nene still wins. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Because let's be for real for a moment like there is no world where she sees the firework with Arisu and
        we just like ignore that ever happened like yea bro we have this whole cliche of the pair falling in love after seeing the firework but nah we just gonna chuck that into fire for fun yea. Like I don't think that is gonna happen. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Also Nene imo has had the most emotional moments with Arisu so surely that means something right<img src = "../assets/images/clueless.png" alt = "clueless.png" class = "footnoteImage"></a>.

        <br>
        <br>

        But yea this manga goes crazy currently I think a 9/10 maybe I might bump this to a 10/10 if Nene (THE GOAT) wins.
