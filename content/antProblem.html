   <h3>My house (or my room at least) has ants</h3>
   <p class='paragraph'>
For some reason my parent's house just suddenly decided to have ants today for some reason and I have no idea why. To be honest I don't
know if it's the entire house that has ants but I know for sure that my room is actually just swarming with them, which is very annoying.
<br>
<br>

Like literally every like 2 minutes I will see a new ant climb onto my desk and start crawling on my arm and it is extremely distracting and
really annoying.

<br>
<br>
Ok like I know we have an entire zoo at our house but like man come on why tf do we have to have ants that is completely unwarranted.

<br>
<br>
I'm gonna be honest if I had to count I think I have squished like at least double digit number of ants now.

<br>
<br>
Bro I am literally writing this and another ant showed up guess its going in the trash now.

<br>
<br>
Also I got no idea how tf I am supposed to find out where they are coming from because my room is literally the most clustered random messy
room every so theres no way I can find some sort of crevice from where the ants come from. I think the angle here is just to pray that the
ants magically decide to give up on my room (hopefully).

<br>
<br>
But yea will keep updates on when the ants leave (if they ever do). All I'm saying is if they don't leave this summer vacation is going to be
absolutely disgusting.
