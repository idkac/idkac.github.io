    <h3>The ramblings of a madman once again</h3>
    <p class='paragraph'>
        So yesterday my family decided to watch <a class = "links" href = "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa">Your Name</a> for some reason, meaning I get to watch
        it again for like the 15th time again.
    </p>
    <p class = "footnote">
        (more like 3rd time but who's counting). 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        And basically as tradition for idkac viewings of Makoto Shinkai films at this point I gotta write some notes as watch the movie, which is why I am writing this blog 
        now to record my notes
    </p>

    <p class = "footnote">
        I will also be putting in some time stamps because I feel like it (I did not feel like putting in time stamps for my Suzume Notes).
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class = "paragraph">
        But yea without further ado let the ramblings of a mad man begin.
