    <h3>idkac Blue Archive experience</h3>

    <p class='paragraph'>
        Blue archive, not sure where to begin with this game. From becoming slightly interested in the game after listening to the Hifumi Daisuki remix to being completely invested into the characters and everything that has to do with Kivotos, this game has really been a defining part of me for the last 2 years. I know this is supposed to be a dedicated section of the blue archive stuff that I saw at anime expo, so I guess I will start there.
