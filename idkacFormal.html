   <h3>Idkac try to be formal challenge (impossible)</h3>
   <pre class='paragraph'>
ok schizo spiel incoming if you dont like me talking weird then you should not read this

ok basically i just did the suzume spiel right and holy crap how tf am i supposed to talk normal its actaully so cringe you can
literally see me in the suzume spiel like switching between talking normal and talking discord speak where i go from being a
normal human being to becoming back to being chronically online. yea idk how im supposed to fix that i guess it is because
this is more of a spiel than an actual document where i talk to human beings so its harder for my brain to turn on the
formal speak (if that makes sense) but yea thats about it.
